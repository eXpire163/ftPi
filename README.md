Cheap and easy to use alternativ to the expensive fischertechnik txt controller.

## what we want
Hardware

- Controlling motors (at least 4, maybe more)
- reading switches (digital read, at least 4)
- reading sensors (analog read)

Software

- flowbased Development ( Known from fischertechnik software)
- webbased controlling (eg: like rc remote , or Smartphone gyro)
- fpv mode (Support for on Board Webcam with live stream)
